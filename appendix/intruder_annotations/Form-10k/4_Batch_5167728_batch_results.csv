The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other detailed information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), contemplate that we will continue as a going concern, and do not contain any adjustments that might result if we were unable to continue as a going concern, however, our independent registered public accounting firm has added explanatory paragraphs in Note E of each of our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.","23718","F-6
